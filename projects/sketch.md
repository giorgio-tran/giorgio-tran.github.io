Sketch is one of my initial projects when I first got started with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This project is an assignment from The Odin Project. It was quite an essential project for my learning because it taught me how to manipulate the DOM. 

In this project I used <a class="md" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forEach</a> and the <a class="md" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grid</a> layout to create the main canvas. An input textbox was also used to have the user select a dimension along with a clear button. Most of the time was spent on figuring out a way to keep the columns and width consistent to the canvas' border. The approach that I took was to make the width and height of the canvas a fixed size. Each individual grid cell also needed to have a height and width of 100%, which enables grid cell responsiveness.
