summary: "A responsive CRUD phonebook that I developed in FullStackOpen"

<img class="img-fluid" src="../img/vacay/vacay-home-page.png">

This is a web application that I created through FullStackOpen. The project helped me learn how to design a CRUD application with the modern MERN tech stack.

This phonebook is implemented with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev) to seamlessly create a single-page [React](https://reactjs.org) application. In the application, the user can search for a contact, add a contact, remove a contact. If an already existing contact is added, the user will be prompted with an update option. 

I gained a lot of experience with full-stack web application through this project. The frontend uses React and CSS with [axios](https://axios-http.com) as the HTTP client. The backend uses [Express](https://expressjs.com), a Node framework, and [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com) for database storage.
