summary: "A responsive CRUD application that I developed in FullStackOpen."
---

This is a web application that I created through FullStackOpen. The project helped me learn how to design a CRUD application with the modern MERN tech stack.

This phonebook is implemented with <a class="md" href="https://create-react-app.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Create React App</a> to seamlessly create a single-page <a class="md" href="https://reactjs.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React</a> application. In the application, the user can search for a contact, add a contact, or remove a contact. If an already existing contact is added, the user will be prompted with an update option. 

I gained a lot of experience with developing a full-stack web application through this project. The frontend uses React and CSS, with <a class="md" href="https://axios-http.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">axios</a> as the HTTP client. The backend uses <a class="md" href="https://expressjs.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Express</a>, a <a class="md" href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Node</a> framework, and <a class="md" href="https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MongoDB Atlas</a> for database storage. Lastly, the application was originally deployed via git to <a class="md" href="https://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heroku</a>. However, since Heroku will no longer be free in November 2022, I redeployed it to <a class="md" href="https://fly.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fly.io.</a> This experience taught me important concepts, such as <a class="md" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</a>
 (CORS), promises, and debugging with both a frontend and a backend.
