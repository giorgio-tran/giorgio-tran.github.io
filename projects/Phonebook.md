summary: "A responsive CRUD application that I developed in FullStackOpen"
---

This is a web application that I created through FullStackOpen. The project helped me learn how to design a CRUD application with the modern MERN tech stack.

This phonebook is implemented with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev) to seamlessly create a single-page [React](https://reactjs.org) application. In the application, the user can search for a contact, add a contact, or remove a contact. If an already existing contact is added, the user will be prompted with an update option. 

I gained a lot of experience with developing a full-stack web application through this project. The frontend uses React and CSS, with [axios](https://axios-http.com) as the HTTP client. The backend uses [Express](https://expressjs.com), a Node framework, and [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) for database storage. Lastly, the application was deployed via git to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). This experience taught me important concepts, such as [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) (CORS), promises, and debugging with both a frontend and a backend.
